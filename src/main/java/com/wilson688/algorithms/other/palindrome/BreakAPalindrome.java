/*
A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward.

Given a palindrome consisting of English letters, replace exactly one character by another English letter so that the resulting string is not a palindrome. There might be more than one way to do this. Return the lexicographically smallest string.

Example 1:
Input: palindrome = "azddza"
Output: aaddza
Explanation:
There are multiple ways to replace a character and get a palindrome, and the lexicographically smallest option is to replace the first z with a.

Example 2:
Input: palindrome = "a"
Output: ""
Explanation:
There's no way to replace exact one character and get a non-palindrome.
