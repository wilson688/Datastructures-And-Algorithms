/*
Write a function that takes a list of numbers and a target number, and then returns the number of unique pairs that add up to the target number.

[X, Y] and [Y, X] are considered the same pair, and not unique.

Examples
Example 1:
Input: [1, 1, 2, 45, 46, 46], target = 47
Output: 2
Explanation:
1 + 46 = 47

2 + 45 = 47

Example 2:
Input: [1, 1], target = 2
Output: 1
Explanation:
1 + 1 = 2

Example 3:
Input: [1, 5, 1, 5], target = 6
Output: 1
Explanation:
[1, 5] and [5, 1] are considered the same, therefore there is only one unique pair that adds up to 6.
