/*
Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support get and put operations.

get(key): Get the value (which will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
put(key, value): Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.
The cache is initialized with a positive capacity.

Can you do both operations in O(1) time complexity?

Input:

operations = ['LRUCache','put','put','get','put','get','put','get','get','get']
input = [[2],[1,1],[2,2],[1],[3,3],[2],[4,4],[1],[3],[4]]
Output:

[null,null,null,1,null,-1,null,-1,3,4]
