/*
On an infinite plane, a robot is programmed to repeat a set of movements indefinitely. The robot starts at position (0, 0) facing north. The movement can be one of three:

"S": go straight 1 unit
"L": turn 90 degrees to the left
"R": turn 90 degrees to the right
Find out if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

Input
movements: a string made up of 'S', 'L', 'R' that determines the robot's future position on the plane.

Output
Return true if the robot is bounded in a circle in the plane; otherwise return false.

Constraints
1 <= movements.length <= 100
Examples
Example 1:
Input: "SSLLSS"
Output: true
Explanation:
The robot moves from (0, 0) to (0, 2), turns 180 degrees to face south, and then returns to (0, 0). The robot remains in the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin at all times.

Example 2:
Input: "SS"
Output: false
Explanation:
The robot moves north indefinitely.
