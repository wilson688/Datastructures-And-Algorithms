/*
Shoe Monster, a popular shopping website for atheletic shoes, would like to know which shoes are frequently bought together.

When a customer purchases two shoes together, we log an edge between the two products. Three shoes that are interconnected form a triple.

A score for a triple can be calculated by counting the total number of shoes outside the triple that are joined with a shoe inside the triple. This is the product sum.

Find the minimum product sum in the graph, or return -1 if no triples exist.

Input
The input to the function/method consists of four arguments:

int products_nodes: the total number of shoe products for sale. Each shoe is identified by a number from 1 to product_nodes.

int products_from[]: the list of products on the left side of each edges

int products_to[]: the list of products on the right side of each edge

Output
int: the minimum product sum or -1 if no triples exist.

Constraints
There is always at least two products and one edge. All edges are valid, ie. they do not refer to itself, and are a valid product number, ie. between 1 and product_nodes.
