Find a pair of entries from two lists that yield a sum that is as close to a target number as possible, without exceeding it.

Each entry in a list is a key-value pair, where the key is a number identifier and the value is also a number. The output must be a list containing the pairs of numbers representing the identifiers that yield the result.

If a solution is not possible, return an empty list.

Input
a = an array of number pairs where the first number is an identifier and the second number is a value.

b = Same as a. Each identifier is unique in each list.

target = a number

Examples
Example 1:
Input:
a = [[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6]], b = [[1, 2]], target = 7,

Output: [[2, 1]]
Explanation:
There are only three possible pairs, [1, 1], [2, 1], and [3, 1]. They yield the sum values of 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 2 = 6 and 6 + 2 = 8 respectively.

6 is the largest number that does not exceed 7, therefore [2, 1] is the optimal pair.

Example 2:
Input:
a = [[1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 7], [4, 10]], b = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]], target = 10,

Output: [[2, 4], [3, 2]]
Explanation:
There are two pairs possible. The element with id = 2 from list a has a value of 5, and the element with id = 4 from list b also has a value of 5. Combined, they add up to 10.

Likewise, the element with id = 3 from a has a value of 7, and the element with id = 2 from b has a value of 3. These also add up to 10.

Therefore, the optimal pairs are [2, 4] and [3, 2].

Example 3:
Input:
a = [[1, 8], [2, 7], [3, 14]], b = [[1, 5], [2, 10], [3, 14]], target = 20,

Output: [[3, 1]]
Example 4:
Input:
a = [[1, 8], [2, 15], [3, 9]], b = [[1, 8], [2, 11], [3, 12]], target = 20,

Output: [[1, 3], [3, 2]]
